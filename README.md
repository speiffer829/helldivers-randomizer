# Helldivers Randomizer
This is a fan-made randomizer for the game Helldivers II. It is not affiliated with the game's developers, Arrowhead Games. 

The idea here is to make a fun challenge for any diver by randomizing all weapons, stratagems, and boosters they take into battle.  This tends to lead to some very unbalanced builds.
